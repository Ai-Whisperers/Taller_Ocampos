COLD CALLING SCRIPT
===================

OPENING (First 30 seconds):
"Hi, this is [Your Name] with [Company]. I work specifically with automotive repair shops to help them eliminate the administrative headaches that keep owners working IN their business instead of ON their business. 

I know you're busy, so I'll be brief - are you currently losing time every day looking for customer information, tracking parts, or creating invoices?"

QUALIFYING QUESTIONS:
If YES: "I thought so - most shop owners tell me they spend 8-10 hours a week on paperwork that should take 2 hours. Can I ask, what's your biggest frustration with your current system?"

If NO: "That's great! Most shops I work with wish they had your organization. Just curious - how do you currently track your customer history and parts inventory?"

PAIN POINT EXPLORATION:
"Let me ask you this - if I could show you how to cut your administrative time in half while never losing customer information again, would that be worth 15 minutes of your time?"

APPOINTMENT SETTING:
"Perfect. I have two brief windows this week - would Thursday at 2 PM or Friday at 10 AM work better for a quick 15-minute call where I can show you exactly how this works?"

OBJECTION HANDLING:

"We're too busy right now"
→ "I understand - and that's exactly why this works so well. The shops that are too busy to get organized are the ones saving the most time with our system. It actually gives you back time by eliminating the daily hunting for information."

"We already have a system"
→ "That's good to hear! Can I ask - does your current system let you find any customer's complete service history in under 10 seconds? And do you always know exactly what parts you have in stock?"

"We can't afford anything right now"
→ "I completely understand cost is a concern. That's why I calculate the exact ROI first. Most shops find they're already spending more in wasted time than the system costs - let me show you the numbers for your specific situation."

"We're not computer people"
→ "Neither are most of my clients! This runs on Excel, which means if you can use a calculator, you can use this system. Plus, we do all the setup and training for you."

INITIAL OUTREACH EMAIL:

Subject: Save 8+ hours/week on shop paperwork?

Hi [Name],

Most auto repair shop owners tell me the same thing: "I became a mechanic to fix cars, not to shuffle paperwork."

If you're spending hours every week:
- Looking for customer information
- Tracking work orders manually  
- Managing parts inventory in your head
- Creating invoices from scratch

...then you're not alone. And you're losing money every single day.

I've helped 50+ shops eliminate these administrative headaches with a proven Excel-based management system. Shops typically save 8-12 hours per week while improving customer service and profitability.

Would you like to see how this could work for your shop?

I offer a free 15-minute "Shop Efficiency Analysis" where I'll show you:
✓ Exactly where you're losing time (and money) with current processes
✓ How the system works with a live demo using your type of shop
✓ Real ROI calculations based on your specific situation

No pressure, no sales pitch - just actionable insights you can use regardless.

Interested? Simply reply with "YES" and I'll send you a link to pick a convenient 15-minute slot.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

P.S. This isn't some expensive monthly software. You own the system completely, and it runs on Excel - no internet required.

FOLLOW-UP EMAIL #2 (1 week later):

Subject: Last follow-up - [Shop Name]

Hi [Name],

This is my final email about the shop management system.

I realize you're either:
1. Not interested (totally fine!)
2. Too busy to respond (I get it)
3. Interested but haven't had time to reply

If it's #3, here's an easy way forward:

Reply with just one word describing your biggest shop management frustration. Examples:
- "PAPERWORK"
- "INVENTORY" 
- "SCHEDULING"
- "INVOICING"

I'll send you a specific 2-minute video showing how we solve that exact problem.

No response needed if this isn't a priority - I won't follow up again.

Thanks,
[Your Name]

REFERRAL REQUEST EMAIL:

Subject: Quick favor request

Hi [Name],

Hope things are going great with your new management system!

Quick question - do you know any other shop owners who might benefit from getting organized like you did?

I'm looking to help 2-3 more shops this quarter, and referrals from successful clients like you are always the best fit.

If anyone comes to mind, I'd be happy to:
✓ Offer them the same great service you received
✓ Give you a $200 referral bonus for any shop that moves forward
✓ Make sure they know you recommended us

No pressure at all - just thought I'd ask!

Thanks again,
[Your Name]

TRADE SHOW/NETWORKING SCRIPT
============================

ELEVATOR PITCH (30 seconds):
"I help auto repair shop owners eliminate the administrative headaches that keep them working 60-hour weeks. Most shops waste 8-10 hours weekly on paperwork that should take 2 hours. I've developed an Excel-based system that typically saves shops $8,000+ annually while improving customer service. What type of business are you in?"

BOOTH CONVERSATION STARTER:
"Hi there! Quick question - if you're in the automotive service industry, what's your biggest daily frustration with paperwork or customer management?"

NETWORKING EVENT APPROACH:
"What line of work are you in? [Wait for response] That's great! I work specifically with auto repair shops helping them get organized and save time. Do you know any shop owners who might be frustrated with their current paperwork systems?"

OBJECTION HANDLING SCRIPTS
==========================

"We're doing fine with our current system"
RESPONSE: "That's great to hear! Just out of curiosity, how long does it take you to find a customer's complete service history, and do you always know exactly what parts you have in stock? [Pause] Most shops that say they're doing fine are actually surprised when they see how much time they could save."

"Excel seems too complicated"
RESPONSE: "I understand that concern! Here's the thing - we do all the setup for you, and the interface is designed so simple that if you can use a calculator, you can use this system. Plus, it's Excel, which means your data is always accessible and you're not locked into some proprietary system."

"What if we outgrow it?"
RESPONSE: "Great question! Excel handles thousands of customers and transactions easily. Plus, because it's Excel, your data can be exported to any other system if you ever decide to upgrade. You're never locked in, and you own your data completely."

"We need to think about it"
RESPONSE: "Absolutely, this is an important decision. Can I ask what specific concerns you'd like to think through? [Listen] I find it helps to see the actual numbers - would it be helpful if I prepared a custom ROI calculation for your shop so you have real data to consider?"

CLOSING TECHNIQUES
==================

ASSUMPTIVE CLOSE:
"Based on what you've told me, it sounds like the Professional Plus package would be perfect for your shop. Should we plan to start implementation next week or the week after?"

ALTERNATIVE CLOSE:
"I can see this would solve your biggest challenges. Would you prefer to start with the Essential package and add features later, or go with the complete Professional Plus package right away?"

URGENCY CLOSE:
"I only take on 3 new implementations per month to ensure quality service. I have one spot left for this month - would you like to secure it, or should I put you on the list for next month?"

RISK REVERSAL CLOSE:
"Let me make this easy for you. We'll implement the complete system with our 30-day money-back guarantee. If you're not completely satisfied with the time savings and organization improvements, I'll refund every penny. Fair enough?"
